# Models from Scratch

This folder contains implementations of machine learning and deep learning models **built entirely from scratch**, without using high-level libraries such as `scikit-learn` or `PyTorch` (only basic tools like `numpy`).  

The goal is to understand the **mathematical foundations** and the **step-by-step mechanics** of how models work internally.

## Implemented Models
- **Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)**: A fully connected feedforward neural network with backpropagation.  
  - Implemented with `numpy` only.  
  - Includes forward propagation, loss calculation,gradient descent optimization and trainable using batches.  

---

## Planned Extensions
- Logistic Regression (baseline model)  
- Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)  
- Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)  
- Transformer (attention-based model)
