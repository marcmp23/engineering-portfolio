# AI Project Portfolio

Welcome to my AI project portfolio! Here you will find a collection of post-degree projects focused on **machine learning, deep learning, and data-driven solutions**, showcasing my skills in **biomedical engineering and software development**.  

> Note: While I have worked on electronics projects (e.g., measuring body impedance to estimate weight), this repository is dedicated exclusively to AI projects.

## About Me
I am a biomedical engineer passionate about creating solutions that combine technology, data, and real-world applications. This portfolio demonstrates my approach to **problem-solving, analytical thinking, and AI-driven development**.

## What You Will Find Here
- **Machine Learning & Deep Learning Projects**: Predictive modeling, data analysis, and AI applications.  
- **Competitions & Challenges**: Solutions developed for hackathons, contests, or personal challenges.  
- **Research & Analysis**: Exploratory data analysis and research-based AI projects.
- **Utility Functions**: Reusable functions and scripts designed to streamline experiments and speed up workflows.

## How to Use This Portfolio
Each project folder contains:
- A detailed description of the project  
- Code and resources needed to run it  
- Notes on methodology and results  

Feel free to explore the projects, provide feedback, or contact me for collaboration opportunities.
